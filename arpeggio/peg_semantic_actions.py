    Semantic actions are executed during semantic analysis. They are in charge
    of producing Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) out of the parse tree.
    Every non-terminal and terminal can have semantic action defined which will
    be triggered during semantic analysis.
    Semantic action triggering is separated in two passes. first_pass method is
    required and the method called second_pass is optional and will be called
    if exists after the first pass. Second pass can be used for forward
    referencing, e.g. linking to the declaration registered in the first pass
    stage.

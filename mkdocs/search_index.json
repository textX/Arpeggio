Parser model is a\ngraph of parser expressions (see \nGrammar\nvisualization\n).  Each node of the graph is\nan instance of some of the classes described above which inherits\n\nParserExpression\n.\n\n\nParser model construction is done during parser instantiation.  For example, to\ninstantiate \ncalc\n parser you do the following:\n\n\nparser = ParserPython(calc)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \ncalc\n is the function defining the root rule of your grammar. There is no\ncode generation. Parser works as an interpreter for your grammar. The grammar is\nused to configure Arpeggio parser to recognize your language (in this case the\n\ncalc\n language). In other words, Arpeggio interprets the parser model (your\ngrammar).\n\n\nAfter parser construction your can call \nparser.parse\n to parse your input\ntext.\n\n\ninput_expr = \"-(4-1)*5+(2+4.67)+5.89/(.2+7)\"\nparse_tree = parser.parse(input_expr)\n\n\n\n\nArpeggio will start from the root node and traverse \nthe parser model graph\n\nconsuming all matched input.  When all root node branches are traversed the\nparsing is done and \nthe parse tree\n is returned.\n\n\nYou can navigate and analyze parse tree or transform it using visitor pattern to\nsome more usable form (see \nSemantic analysis - Visitors\n)\n\n\nGrammars written in PEG notations\n\n\nGrammars can also be specified using PEG notation. There are actually two of\nthem at the moment and both notations are implemented using canonical Python\nbased grammars (see modules\n\narpeggio.peg\n\nand\n\narpeggio.cleanpeg\n).\n\n\nThere are no significant differences between those two syntax. The first one use\nmore traditional approach using \n<-\n for rule assignment, \n//\n for line comments\nand \n;\n for the rule terminator.  The second syntax (from \narpeggio.cleanpeg\n)\nuses \n=\n for assignment, does not use rule terminator and use \n#\n for line\ncomments. Which one you choose is totally up to you. If your don't like any of\nthese syntaxes you can make your own (look at \narpeggio.peg\n and\n\narpeggio.cleanpeg\n modules as an examples).\n\n\nAn example of the \ncalc\n grammar given in PEG syntax (\narpeggio.cleanpeg\n):\n\n\nnumber = r'\\d*\\.\\d*|\\d+'\nfactor = (\"+\" / \"-\")? (number / \"(\" expression \")\")\nterm = factor (( \"*\" / \"/\") factor)*\nexpression = term ((\"+\" / \"-\") term)*\ncalc = expression+ EOF\n\n\n\n\nEach grammar rule is given as an assignment where the lhs is the rule name (e.g.\n\nnumber\n) and the rhs is a PEG expression.\n\n\n\n\nLiteral string matches\n are given as strings (e.g. \n\"+\"\n).\n\n\nRegex matches\n are given as strings with prefix \nr\n (e.g.\n  \nr'\\d*\\.\\d*|\\d+'\n).\n\n\nSequence\n is a space separated list of expressions (e.g. \nexpression+\n  EOF\n is a sequence of two expressions).\n\n\nOrdered choice\n is a list of expression separated with \n/\n (e.g. \n\"+\" /\n  \"-\"\n).\n\n\nZero or more\n expression is specified by \n*\n operator (e.g. \n(( \"*\" /\n  \"/\" ) factor)*\n).\n\n\nOne of more\n is specified by \n+\n operator (e.g. \nexpression+\n).\n\n\n\n\nAnd\n and \nNot\n predicates are also supported.\n\n\n\n\nAnd predicate\n is specified by \n&\n operator (e.g. \n&expression\n - not\n  used in the grammar above).\n\n\nNot predicate\n is specified by \n!\n operator (e.g. \n!expression\n - not\n  used in the grammar above).\n\n\n\n\nIn the rhs a rule reference is a name of another rule. Parser will try to match\nanother rule at that location.\n\n\nSpecial rule \nEOF\n will match end of input string.\n\n\nCreating a parser using PEG syntax is done by the class \nParserPEG\n from the\n\narpeggio.peg\n or \narpeggio.cleanpeg\n modules.\n\n\nfrom arpeggio.cleanpeg import ParserPEG\nparser = ParserPEG(calc_grammar, \"calc\")\n\n\n\n\nWhere \ncalc_grammar\n is a string with the grammar given above and the\n\n\"calc\"\n is the name of the root rule of the grammar.\n\n\nAfter this you get the same parser as with the \nParserPython\n. There is no\ndifference at all so you can parse the same language.\n\n\ninput_expr = \"-(4-1)*5+(2+4.67)+5.89/(.2+7)\"\nparse_tree = parser.parse(input_expr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nJust remember that using textual PEG syntax imposes a slight overhead since\nthe grammar must be parsed and the parser for your language must be built by\nsemantic analysis of grammar parse tree.  If you plan to instantiate your\nparser once and than use it many times this shall not have that much of\nperformance hit but if your workflow introduce instantiating parser each time\nyour parse some input than consider defining your grammar using Python as it\nwill start faster.

Here is an example of arpeggio grammar for simple calculator:  def number():     return _(r'\\d*\\.\\d*|\\d+')\ndef factor():     return Optional([\"+\",\"-\"]), [number,\n                          (\"(\", expression, \")\")]\ndef term():       return factor, ZeroOrMore([\"*\",\"/\"], factor)\ndef expression(): return term, ZeroOrMore([\"+\", \"-\"], term)\ndef calc():       return OneOrMore(expression), EOF  Each rule is given in the form of Python function. Python function returns data\nstructure that maps to PEG expressions.   Sequence  is represented as Python tuple.  Ordered choice  is represented as Python list where each element is one\n  alternative.  One or more  is represented as an instance of  OneOrMore  class.\n  The parameters are treated as a containing sequence.  Zero or more  is represented as an instance of  ZeroOrMore  class.\n  The parameters are treated as a containing sequence.  Optional  is represented as an instance of  Optional  class.  And predicate  is represented as an instance of  And  class.  Not predicate  is represented as an instance of  Not  class.  Literal string match  is represented as string or regular expression given\n  as an instance of  RegExMatch  class.  End of string/file  is recognized by the  EOF  special rule.   For example, the  calc  language consists of one or more  expression  and\nend of file.  factor  rule consists of optional  +  or  -  char matched in that order\n(they are given in Python list thus ordered choice) followed by the ordered\nchoice of  number  rule and a sequence of  expression  rule in brackets.\nThis rule will match an optional sign ( +  or  -  tried in that order) after\nwhich follows a  number  or an  expression  in brackets (tried in that\norder).  From this description Arpeggio builds  the parser model . Parser model is a\ngraph of parser expressions (see  Grammar\nvisualization ).  Each node of the graph is\nan instance of some of the classes described above which inherits ParserExpression .  Parser model construction is done during parser instantiation.  For example, to\ninstantiate  calc  parser you do the following:  parser = ParserPython(calc)  Where  calc  is the function defining the root rule of your grammar. There is no\ncode generation. Parser works as an interpreter for your grammar. The grammar is\nused to configure Arpeggio parser to recognize your language (in this case the calc  language). In other words, Arpeggio interprets the parser model (your\ngrammar).  After parser construction your can call  parser.parse  to parse your input\ntext.  input_expr = \"-(4-1)*5+(2+4.67)+5.89/(.2+7)\"\nparse_tree = parser.parse(input_expr)  Arpeggio will start from the root node and traverse  the parser model graph \nconsuming all matched input.  When all root node branches are traversed the\nparsing is done and  the parse tree  is returned.  You can navigate and analyze parse tree or transform it using visitor pattern to\nsome more usable form (see  Semantic analysis - Visitors )",

            "text": "Grammars can also be specified using PEG notation. There are actually two of\nthem at the moment and both notations are implemented using canonical Python\nbased grammars (see modules arpeggio.peg \nand arpeggio.cleanpeg ).  There are no significant differences between those two syntax. The first one use\nmore traditional approach using  <-  for rule assignment,  //  for line comments\nand  ;  for the rule terminator.  The second syntax (from  arpeggio.cleanpeg )\nuses  =  for assignment, does not use rule terminator and use  #  for line\ncomments. Which one you choose is totally up to you. If your don't like any of\nthese syntaxes you can make your own (look at  arpeggio.peg  and arpeggio.cleanpeg  modules as an examples).  An example of the  calc  grammar given in PEG syntax ( arpeggio.cleanpeg ):  number = r'\\d*\\.\\d*|\\d+'\nfactor = (\"+\" / \"-\")? (number / \"(\" expression \")\")\nterm = factor (( \"*\" / \"/\") factor)*\nexpression = term ((\"+\" / \"-\") term)*\ncalc = expression+ EOF  Each grammar rule is given as an assignment where the lhs is the rule name (e.g. number ) and the rhs is a PEG expression.   Literal string matches  are given as strings (e.g.  \"+\" ).  Regex matches  are given as strings with prefix  r  (e.g.\n   r'\\d*\\.\\d*|\\d+' ).  Sequence  is a space separated list of expressions (e.g.  expression+\n  EOF  is a sequence of two expressions).  Ordered choice  is a list of expression separated with  /  (e.g.  \"+\" /\n  \"-\" ).  Zero or more  expression is specified by  *  operator (e.g.  (( \"*\" /\n  \"/\" ) factor)* ).  One of more  is specified by  +  operator (e.g.  expression+ ).   And  and  Not  predicates are also supported.   And predicate  is specified by  &  operator (e.g.  &expression  - not\n  used in the grammar above).  Not predicate  is specified by  !  operator (e.g.  !expression  - not\n  used in the grammar above).   In the rhs a rule reference is a name of another rule. Parser will try to match\nanother rule at that location.  Special rule  EOF  will match end of input string.  Creating a parser using PEG syntax is done by the class  ParserPEG  from the arpeggio.peg  or  arpeggio.cleanpeg  modules.  from arpeggio.cleanpeg import ParserPEG\nparser = ParserPEG(calc_grammar, \"calc\")  Where  calc_grammar  is a string with the grammar given above and the \"calc\"  is the name of the root rule of the grammar.  After this you get the same parser as with the  ParserPython . There is no\ndifference at all so you can parse the same language.  input_expr = \"-(4-1)*5+(2+4.67)+5.89/(.2+7)\"\nparse_tree = parser.parse(input_expr)   Note  Just remember that using textual PEG syntax imposes a slight overhead since\nthe grammar must be parsed and the parser for your language must be built by\nsemantic analysis of grammar parse tree.  If you plan to instantiate your\nparser once and than use it many times this shall not have that much of\nperformance hit but if your workflow introduce instantiating parser each time\nyour parse some input than consider defining your grammar using Python as it\nwill start faster.  Nevertheless, the parsing performance will be the same in\nboth approach since the same code for parsing is used.",

The whole content of \ncsv_peg.py\n should be:\n\n\nfrom arpeggio.cleanpeg import ParserPEG\n\ncsv_grammar = open('csv.peg', 'r').read()\nparser = ParserPEG(csv_grammar, 'csvfile', ws='\\t ')\n\n\n\n\nHere we load the grammar from \ncsv.peg\n file and construct the parser using\n\nParserPEG\n class.\n\n\nThe rest of the code is the same as in \ncsv.py\n. We load \ntest_data.csv\n and\ncall \nparser.parse\n on it to produce parse tree.\n\n\nTo verify that everything works without errors execute \ncsv_peg.py\n module.\n\n\n$ python csv_peg.py\n\n\n\n\nIf we put the parser in debug mode and generate parse tree image we can \nverify that we are getting the same parse tree regardless of the grammar\nspecification approach we use.\n\n\nTo put parser in debug mode add \ndebug=True\n to the parser parameters list.\n\n\nparser = ParserPEG(csv_grammar, 'csvfile', ws='\\t ', debug=True)\n\n\n\n\nExtract data\n\n\nOur main goal is to extract data from the \ncsv\n file.\n\n\nThe parse tree we get as a result of parsing is not very useful on its own.\nWe need to transform it to some other data structure that we can use.\n\n\nFirst lets define our target data structure we want to get.\n\n\nSince \ncsv\n consists of list of records where each record consists of fields\nwe shall construct python list of lists:\n\n\n  [\n    [field1, field2, field3, ...],  # First row\n    [field1, field2, field3,...],   # Second row\n    [...],  # ...\n    ...\n  ]\n\n\n\nTo construct this list of list we may process parse tree by navigating its\nnodes and building the required target data structure.\nBut, it is easier to use Arpeggio's support for \nsemantic analysis - Visitor\nPattern\n.\n\n\nLet's make a Visitor for CSV that will build our list of lists.\n\n\nclass CSVVisitor(PTNodeVisitor):\n    def visit_record(self, node, children):\n        # record is a list of fields. The children nodes are fields so just\n        # transform it to python list.\n        return list(children)\n\n    def visit_csvfile(self, node, children):\n        # We are not interested in empty lines so we will filter them.\n        return [x for x in children if x!='\\n']\n\n\n\n\nand apply this visitor to the parse tree:\n\n\ncsv_content = visit_parse_tree(parse_tree, CSVVisitor())\n\n\n\n\nNow if we pretty-print \ncsv_content\n we can see that it is exactly what we wanted:\n\n\n[   [   u'Unquoted test',\n        u'Quoted test',\n        u'23234',\n        u'One Two Three',\n        u'343456.45'],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 2',\n        u'Quoted test with \"\"inner\"\" quotes',\n        u'23234',\n        u'One Two Three',\n        u'34312.7'],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 3',\n        u'Quoted test 3',\n        u'23234',\n        u'One Two Three',\n        u'343486.12']]\n\n\n\n\nBut, there is more we can do. If we look at our data we can see that some fields\nare of numeric type but they end up as strings in our target structure. Let's\nconvert them to Python floats or ints.  To do this conversion we will introduce\n\nvisit_field\n method in our \nCSVVisitor\n class.\n\n\nclass CSVVisitor(PTNodeVisitor):\n  ...\n  def visit_field(self, node, children):\n      value = children[0]\n      try:\n          return float(value)\n      except:\n          pass\n      try:\n          return int(value)\n      except:\n          return value\n  ...\n\n\n\n\nIf we pretty-print \ncsv_content\n now we can see that numeric values are not strings\nanymore but a proper Python types.\n\n\n[   [u'Unquoted test', u'Quoted test', 23234.0, u'One Two Three', 343456.45],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 2',\n        u'Quoted test with \"\"inner\"\" quotes',\n        23234.0,\n        u'One Two Three',\n        34312.7],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 3',\n        u'Quoted test 3',\n        23234.0,\n        u'One Two Three',\n        343486.12]]\n\n\n\n\nThis example code can be found \nhere\n.",

Double quote inside data must\n  be escaped by doubling it ( \"\" ).    The whole grammar (i.e. the contents of  csv.peg  file) is:    csvfile = (record / r'\\n')+ EOF\n  record = field (\",\" field)*\n  field = quoted_field / field_content\n  field_content = r'([^,\\n])+'\n  quoted_field = '\"' field_content_quoted '\"'\n  field_content_quoted = r'((\"\")|([^\"]))+'  Now, we shall create  csv_peg.py  file in order to instantiate our parser and\nparse inputs.  This time we shall instantiate different parser class\n( ParserPEG ). The whole content of  csv_peg.py  should be:  from arpeggio.cleanpeg import ParserPEG\n\ncsv_grammar = open('csv.peg', 'r').read()\nparser = ParserPEG(csv_grammar, 'csvfile', ws='\\t ')  Here we load the grammar from  csv.peg  file and construct the parser using ParserPEG  class.  The rest of the code is the same as in  csv.py . We load  test_data.csv  and\ncall  parser.parse  on it to produce parse tree.  To verify that everything works without errors execute  csv_peg.py  module.  $ python csv_peg.py  If we put the parser in debug mode and generate parse tree image we can \nverify that we are getting the same parse tree regardless of the grammar\nspecification approach we use.  To put parser in debug mode add  debug=True  to the parser parameters list.  parser = ParserPEG(csv_grammar, 'csvfile', ws='\\t ', debug=True)",

            "text": "Our main goal is to extract data from the  csv  file.  The parse tree we get as a result of parsing is not very useful on its own.\nWe need to transform it to some other data structure that we can use.  First lets define our target data structure we want to get.  Since  csv  consists of list of records where each record consists of fields\nwe shall construct python list of lists:    [\n    [field1, field2, field3, ...],  # First row\n    [field1, field2, field3,...],   # Second row\n    [...],  # ...\n    ...\n  ]  To construct this list of list we may process parse tree by navigating its\nnodes and building the required target data structure.\nBut, it is easier to use Arpeggio's support for  semantic analysis - Visitor\nPattern .  Let's make a Visitor for CSV that will build our list of lists.  class CSVVisitor(PTNodeVisitor):\n    def visit_record(self, node, children):\n        # record is a list of fields. The children nodes are fields so just\n        # transform it to python list.\n        return list(children)\n\n    def visit_csvfile(self, node, children):\n        # We are not interested in empty lines so we will filter them.\n        return [x for x in children if x!='\\n']  and apply this visitor to the parse tree:  csv_content = visit_parse_tree(parse_tree, CSVVisitor())  Now if we pretty-print  csv_content  we can see that it is exactly what we wanted:  [   [   u'Unquoted test',\n        u'Quoted test',\n        u'23234',\n        u'One Two Three',\n        u'343456.45'],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 2',\n        u'Quoted test with \"\"inner\"\" quotes',\n        u'23234',\n        u'One Two Three',\n        u'34312.7'],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 3',\n        u'Quoted test 3',\n        u'23234',\n        u'One Two Three',\n        u'343486.12']]  But, there is more we can do. If we look at our data we can see that some fields\nare of numeric type but they end up as strings in our target structure. Let's\nconvert them to Python floats or ints.  To do this conversion we will introduce visit_field  method in our  CSVVisitor  class.  class CSVVisitor(PTNodeVisitor):\n  ...\n  def visit_field(self, node, children):\n      value = children[0]\n      try:\n          return float(value)\n      except:\n          pass\n      try:\n          return int(value)\n      except:\n          return value\n  ...  If we pretty-print  csv_content  now we can see that numeric values are not strings\nanymore but a proper Python types.  [   [u'Unquoted test', u'Quoted test', 23234.0, u'One Two Three', 343456.45],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 2',\n        u'Quoted test with \"\"inner\"\" quotes',\n        23234.0,\n        u'One Two Three',\n        34312.7],\n    [   u'Unquoted test 3',\n        u'Quoted test 3',\n        23234.0,\n        u'One Two Three',\n        343486.12]]  This example code can be found  here .",

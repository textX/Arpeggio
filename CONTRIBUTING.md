# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!. You can contribute
code, documentation, tests, bug reports. Every little bit helps, and credit will
always be given. If you plan to make a contribution it would be great if you
first announce that on [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/textX/Arpeggio/issues).

You can contribute in many ways:


## Types of Contributions


### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/textX/Arpeggio/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.


### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.


### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.


### Write Documentation

Arpeggio could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official
Arpeggio docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and
such.

#### How to Test the Documentation Locally

Arpeggio is currently using `mkdocs`, a documentation generator, to generate the docs into html files. 

To test the docs locally, you need to follow the first 3 instructions at the
[Get Started!](#get-started) section

To render the docs in you browser run:

    just servedocs

`mkdocs` will run a webserver that serves the documentation at 127.0.0.1:8000

To make changes to the configurations, you can look at `mkdocs.yml`. For more
information on how to use mkdocs, visit this [site](https://www.mkdocs.org).


### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/textX/Arpeggio/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)


## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Arpeggio` for local development.

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) Python
   package/project manager and [just](https://github.com/casey/just) task runner.

2. Fork the `Arpeggio` repo on GitHub.

3. Clone your fork locally:

        git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/Arpeggio.git
        
4. Create a branch for local development::

        cd Arpeggio/
        git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes:
   - Reformat code:

        just reformat

   and verify that all checks pass:
   
        just check

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        git add .
        git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Check [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write nice
   git log messages.

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. CI will run the tests for
   all supported Python versions. Check in the GitHub UI that all pipelines pass.


## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds/changes functionality, the docs should be updated. 
3. The pull request should work for supported Python versions. Check
   https://github.com/textX/Arpeggio/actions and make sure that
   the tests pass for all supported Python versions.


## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```
just test tests/func/mytest.py
```

or a single test:

```
just test tests/func/mytest.py::some_test
```

To serve docs locally:

```
just servedocs
```

To see all `just` options:
```
just
```
